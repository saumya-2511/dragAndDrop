# Front end assignment

---

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to evaluate your front-end development skills, specifically in implementing a drag and drop interface. You are required to build a simple web page that allows users to drag and drop items between two containers.

Requirements:

1. Implement a drag and drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Create two containers (e.g., div elements) side by side on the page.
3. Populate the first container with a list of items (e.g., images, text, or icons).
4. Allow users to drag and drop items from the first container to the second container.
5. Provide visual feedback during dragging (e.g., change the appearance of the dragged item).
6. When an item is dropped into the second container, display a success message or update the UI in any appropriate way.
7. Add a reset button to clear the second container and reset the first container to its original state.
